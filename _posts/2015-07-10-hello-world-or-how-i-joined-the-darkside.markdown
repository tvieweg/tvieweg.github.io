By almost any standard, especially software, I am late to the game. 

I have to confess. I was scared of code. When I first started looking into a career in the technical world, code looked interesting, and exciting. Then I took my first Java course. The instructor required us to write code using only text editors. I got frustrated, confused, and annoyed. I finished my class and vowed to stay away from code. 

For ten years, I kept to that promise. I worked in the satellite communications and electronics manufacturing world, working mostly in hardware. Software? That magical creature that made the lights work on my satellite terminals? I knew the big picture, but nothing more. Even as I worked as a systems engineer, I worked with code in little neat packages I could move around block diagrams. I spent a total of maybe 8 hours on a command line in 8 years of work as a technical lead. 

Then I joined the real darkside, program and product management. It was (and continues to be) exciting, new, and a constant learning experience swimming in the deep end of business development. But I was two steps removed from nearly every real creator of any project I worked on. At the end of the day the strategy was exciting, but the meetings and presentations left me feeling hollow, even when the product was successful. I wanted to create again. 

The more I thought of it, the more I wanted to create something I could use, preferably use often. Even better if it was daily. So, I finally opened Xcode, and started toying around. After toying around a bit, I decided to get serious. So I've spent the past six months starting down the road of iOS development, culminating in the Bloc bootcamp, which I'll complete this fall. 

This is a log of my journey into the (until recently) mysterious world of code. It won't always be pretty, but I think that's a good sign.
