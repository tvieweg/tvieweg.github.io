title: Lessons from my first year of coding. 
layout: post
---
Like I mentioned in the first post, little less than a year ago I started getting interested in coding. I can't really say why. Maybe because a lot of my friends were doing it and seemed to enjoy themselves. Maybe because I was just curious. Maybe because I didn't like my current job. Maybe all of the above. 

Problem was, I didn't really know where to start. I fooled around in Xcode, and moved on to trying to learn through [codeacademy](http://www.codeacademy.com/) and [codeschool](http://www.codeschool.com/). It was fun, and I liked the lessons, but I was unsure of where to go next. I felt like I understood the very basics, and from my time as a systems engineer I knew some of the high level concepts of programming. But bridging those two with the middle knowledge of how to design and implement an application never came to me. I needed more practice, but less guidance. 

While in NYC, I asked developer/generally smart human James Dennis about this dilemma. He suggested I try [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/), and that I follow the rules of the book exactly. The book recommends typing out every line of code, and doing so without the use of an IDE, to avoid becoming lazy and relying solely on the IDE to complete your code. At the time I was on the road and in the back of a van for 6+ hours a day, so this seemed like a perfect way to kill time. I went to work on the lessons.

The book took me about a month and a half to go through. When I came out the other end, I was hooked. The challenges were hard with ever decreasing guidance as the book progressed. I found this fun, and it forced me learn outside of the book and become more self sufficient to solve my problems. I felt much more accomplished, and now felt like I had to understand everything that was going on under the hood. I had some notion in my head that all "real" developers understand the entire inner workings of every line of code, process and bit that was changed. I knew this was wrong, but I couldn’t tell which parts were important to know, and which parts didn’t really matter. Without that knowledge, I felt I couldn't really do well in the field. 

This was my original drive to join [Bloc](http://www.bloc.io). I needed someone working with me who could be a guide, and tell me what was important to know and what wasn’t. It turned out to be a great experience, and one that I’ll write a lot more about at some point, but for now I want to focus on some early learnings. 

Combing Stack Overflow and other sites, I slowly realized everyone has some gap in knowledge, and is somewhere along the continuum from total novice to complete expert. The point is to be curious and be able to problem solve and find the information you need. The Internet has made this incredibly easy, all you need is a little patience to dig in a couple layers to any problem you need. 

So, with a long introduction, here are my takeaways from my first year of coding: 

Stop Being Intimidated
---------------------------------

Software, and sometimes the people who develop it, can be intimidating. I struggled a lot with the jargon of object oriented programming, and the language of Software. I still struggle with it. I find writing about it to be helpful, as it forces you to really breakdown the meaning of a class, method, etc.  
The big lesson for me was to not be intimidated by the jargon, the philosophical debates on spaces vs. tabs, the sweeping decrees about the best and ways to handle certain problems faced when coding. None of this is important to learning to code, or creating things for that matter. Focus first on creating things. Learn something every time you add a new feature. Don't worry if it's messy. You'll get better.

Know A Little About A Lot 
-------------------------------------

###(and A Lot About A Little)

In a similar vein, I’ve reminded myself several times that you can’t know everything. Know a little about a lot of things. Know a lot about a few things. Keep doing this over and over again. Eventually, you’ll know a lot about a lot of things. 

Bang Your Head Against The Wall
--------------------------------------------------
### (It’s Good for You)

Stack Overflow, Quora, and the internet in general are incredible tools to find any knowledge you may need. It’s even easier for software. I’ve found only a handful of issues over the past year that I couldn’t fix with a 30 minute hunt on the internet. 

But I want to advocate for something very different when you first encounter problems, particularly if you think they are fundamental to your app: Bang your head against the wall. Spend a couple hours on your own digging through the Apple reference docs and code base trying to solve your issue. Try a few things. Break your app. Try a few more things. Break your app again. 

These hours have in the long run provided me with a lot more learning. They sharpen your problem solving skills, and make you a better thinker. I remember the lessons of these issues for much longer than the issues I fixed with a quick google search. They also help prepare me for the inevitable times while programming that I will get stuck, and there will be no Stack Overflow answer to save me. I used to loathe these times as a programmer, but now I cherish them. 

Embrace Your Ignorance
------------------------------------

After those couple hours I recommend above, stop being so hard on yourself. Resist the boiling frustration that comes up, saying “you’ll never be good at this, you should have the answer!” 

You are new at this. It should be hard. You are not required to know everything. Go find the answer from people more knowledgeable. Embrace your ignorance. 

Just Try It
