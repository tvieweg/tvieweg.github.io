title: App Design - Muttro
layout: post
---
Muttro was my first project after the basics section of the Bloc bootcamp. I had a new 10 week old puppy and suddenly found myself constantly searching for dog attractions. I decided to build an app dedicated to searching for all things dog related. 

One of the main tasks was building custom annotations and callouts for maps to identify categories for users to easily see what each point of interest (POI) was. 

The second big task in this app was using the Yelp API to power my searches.
